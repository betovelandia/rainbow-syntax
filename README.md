# Rainbow Syntax Theme

This is a template I created based on the need to have a decent syntax theme
for Babel/ES6 Javascript code.

### Notes and best practices

* Define proper colors in your `syntax-variables.less` file. Other packages
  can use these variables. All the variables defined in this package's
  `syntax-variables.less` file must be defined &mdash; you cannot pick and choose.
* Always have a high-quality screenshot in the README
* The `colors.less` file is not necessary, but it's good practice.
